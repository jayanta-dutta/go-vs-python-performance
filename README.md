# Go vs Python for DevOps: Choosing the Right Tool

## Reference for multiprocessing : [README.md](multiprocessing/README.md)

## Reference for multithreading :  [README.md](multithreading/README.md)


This project explores the strengths and use cases of Go and Python in DevOps, focusing on performance, automation, scripting, and concurrency.

# üöÄ When to Use Go?

‚úÖ High-performance CLI tools (e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker)

‚úÖ Scalable microservices & APIs (e.g., Prometheus, Vault)

‚úÖ Concurrency-heavy tasks (e.g., log processing, CI/CD optimizations)

# üêç When to Use Python?

‚úÖ Cloud automation (e.g., AWS Boto3, GCP SDK, Ansible)

‚úÖ CI/CD scripting (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins automation)

‚úÖ Log parsing & monitoring (e.g., ELK, Splunk, Grafana)

# üí° Conclusion
- Use Go for high-performance, scalable, and concurrent DevOps tools.
- Use Python for automation, scripting, and cloud API integrations.
- Hybrid Approach: Use Go for CLI tools/APIs and Python for automation.
