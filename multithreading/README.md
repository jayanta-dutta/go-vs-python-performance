## Multithreading comparison Go vs Python

## Go
 go run (file path)
- Execution Time: 56.161084ms
- Uses all CPU cores effectively
- Lightweight goroutines â†’ faster execution


## Python 
  Python3 (file path)
- Execution Time: 6.392580986022949
- Due to Pythonâ€™s GIL, threads run sequentially (not in parallel).
- Same performance as a single-threaded program.


## Why is Python so Slow in Multi-threading?
ðŸš« Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):

Only one Python thread can execute at a time, even on multi-core CPUs.
Threads donâ€™t run in parallel for CPU-bound tasks (they just take turns).

ðŸš« Thread Overhead:

Python threads have high context-switching costs.
The GIL locks/unlocks the interpreter, slowing down execution.

âœ… Go wins because:

No GIL â†’ Threads truly run in parallel across all CPU cores.
Lightweight goroutines â†’ Less overhead compared to Python threads.

# ðŸš€ Conclusion
Goâ€™s goroutines are much faster than Python threads because they allow true multi-threading without GIL interference.
Python threads are only useful for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, database queries).
